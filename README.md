# Fake-News-Detection

This project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. 
Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset.

Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. 
In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.

The dataset used has a shape of 7796Ã—4. The first column identifies the news, the second and third are the title and text, and the fourth column has labels denoting whether the news is REAL or FAKE.
